# MobileHealthVan

## Project Overview
Widespread chronic disease prevalence is a significant issue across the United States, disproportionately affecting individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Mobile health vans offer an innovative solution to address healthcare disparities by providing prevention, screening, and other triage services. Our work provides a detailed overview of a comprehensive dataset from the Mobile Health Map project, including the distribution of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded mobile vans, and the 2023 CDC PLACES dataset, which includes 45 health-related measures at the census-tract level. We developed an interactive R Shiny Dashboard to visualize the locations of mobile health vans in relation to PLACES health measures. This tool aims to facilitate the reuse of this data by researchers, policymakers, and public health officials, enabling informed decision-making to enhance population-level health outcomes and expand opportunities for quality care in underserved populations.
